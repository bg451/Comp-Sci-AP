      <h3>States of Matters: Gase, liquids, solids</h3>
      <ul>
        <b>Gas</b>: Total disorder, much empty space, particles have complete freedom of motion, particles far apart
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <b>Liquid</b>: Disorder, particles or clusters of particles
      </ul>
        Effect of temperture and pressure. Lower temperture and higher pressure causes particles to condense, with the excpetion for water
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>How are molecules held together?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It is becuase of the intermolecular forces or Van Der Wals forces</li>
        <li>The stronger the force between the intermolecular forces the more energy is needed to break them so that they can change from solid to liquid to gas</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3 > Three types of intermolecular forces </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          London Dispersion Forces: The only intermolecular force found in nonpolar covalent molecules and nbole gases, very very weak. Arises when the positive end of one temporary dipole is attracted to the negative end of another temporary dipole
          <ul>
            N---N or H---H
            <br />
            The more the molecular mass the stronger the sipersion force, like gravitational forces.
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Dipole-dipole forces: Exists only between plar molecules, 1/100 as strong as covalent bond. Arises from the electrostatic attraction between the positive end of one dipole of one molecule and the negative end of an adjacent dipole of another molecule
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Hydrofen Bond: A very strong dipole-dipole attraction between molecules that has hydrogen atoms. 1/10 as storng as covalent bond
          <ul>Eg. H2O, NH3, CH3OH, HF</ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3> Change of state </h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Boilin gpoint: the temperture at which the vapor pressures equal the external presuure acing on a liquid. The less external pressure there is, the lower the boiling point is
          <ul>
            <li>At lower pressure, the boiling point will also be lower at higher pressure, the boiling point is higher</li>
            <li>This is why pressure cooker cooks food faster because of higher pressyre means hotter the temperture</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Evaporation: The process in which the particles have enough energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that hold them together to become a gas
          <ul> Molar heat of vaporization: THe amount of energy to change 1 mold of liquid to its vapo for water is 40.6kj/mole @ 100 celsius</ul>
        </li>

      </ol>
